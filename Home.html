			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<br>

		<div>
		<p>
			Doaba Hospital was founded in 2000 by <b>Dr. Bachittar Singh</b>(M.D. Orthology) & <b>Dr. Rita</b>(M.D. Radiology) in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar with a vision of helping people. There was only one radiologist in town at that time. Growing at a really fast pace, we were able to get the latest technology required in medical sciences such as MRI, CT Scan etc. We believe that medicine should be available for everyone, hence medical fees is never an issue. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br>We understand responsibility better than privilege and practice accountability better than business. Hence, let us all make a wonderful world and give us the oppurtunity to serve you.
